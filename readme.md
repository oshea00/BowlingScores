## Bowling scores.

 Bowling Scores.
 I used to do a lot a of manual scoring at
 tournaments and leagues in smaller bowling
 alleys w/o automatic scoring. So, this is a   
 little nostalgic foray into keeping score!    
 Note: The rules are surprisingly complicated  
 mainly due to trying to insure a valid game,  
 then applying the rules to score a valid game 
 The actual score method is fairly simple from 
 there.
